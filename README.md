ðŸ“ˆ Maclaurin Series Approximator
This Python script calculates the Maclaurin series approximation of a user-defined function f(x) up to order N, evaluates it at points within a given range r, and visualizes the approximation.

ðŸš€ Features
Symbolic differentiation using SymPy

Series term computation with factorials

Evaluation over integer points in [-r, r]

Visualization using Matplotlib

ðŸ§  How It Works
Takes a function f(x) as input.

Computes derivatives at x = 0.

Builds the Maclaurin series up to N terms.

Evaluates and plots the approximation over [-r, r].

ðŸ§ª Example Input
text
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
f(x) = sin(x)
x = 0
r = 5
N = 10

ðŸ“¦ Requirements

sympy
matplotlib

Install them with:

bash
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
pip install sympy matplotlib
ðŸ“Š Output
Prints the last evaluated value of the series.

Displays a plot of the approximated values.
